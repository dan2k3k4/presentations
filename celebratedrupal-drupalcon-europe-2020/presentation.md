### What does it mean to celebrate?

Celebrations can be both: <!-- .element style="margin-top: 10rem" -->

- planned and unplanned <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
- happy and somber <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
- large and small <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

People celebrate to mark the time.<br />
To intentionally create a memory. <!-- .element class="fragment" style="margin-top: 4rem" -->

Note: Celebrations can be both.

Planned and unplanned: such as birthdays or a last-minute invite from a friend to catch up over drinks.

Happy and somber: somber like a funeral is a celebration of life.

People celebrate to mark the time.

### Why Celebrate Drupal? <!-- .element style="margin-bottom: 6rem;" -->

<span style="font-size: 1.3em">Drupal 9 marked the "last migration"</span>

<span class="fragment" style="font-size: 1.3em">Code deprecation<span class="fragment"><em>\* (more on this later!)</em></span></span>

<span class="fragment" style="font-size: 1.3em">Upgraded dependencies.</span>

<span class="fragment" style="font-size: 1.3em">We continuously raise the bar.</span>

Note: Drupal 9 marked the "last migration", we should no longer need to do any large complex data wrangling migrations that we did to go from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8.

A lot of old code was deprecated during Drupal 8 and then removed in Drupal 9.

We upgraded a few of the main dependencies such as Symfony 3 to 4.4.

For the past 20 years, we have been continuously improving Drupal and raising the bar.

We really should celebrate this.

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="#B45309" data-auto-animate data-id="why-celebrate" -->

### Why Celebrate Drupal? <!-- .element style="margin-bottom: 6rem;" -->

I searched for any planned events for the Drupal 9 release.

However, I found nothing concrete.<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

I wanted to celebrate the launch of Drupal 9 together as a community.<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

I wanted everyone to experience a positive event in the cloud of uncertainty.<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

Note: I searched around for any planned events for the Drupal 9 release party.

However, I found nothing. I asked in Slack, and everyone was occupied with the pandemic affecting them, we were in lockdown in many countries.

I wanted to celebrate, not just because of the reasons I mentioned in the previous slide.

But also because I believe by celebrating something each day, you reinforce positive vibes and in turn other people around you may become happier as a result.

### April 10th 2020

# 54 days until Drupal 9 is launched.

Note: With just 54 days until Drupal 9 is due to be launched, I did not have much time.

I needed to figure out what I want to build and how.

However, whatever I want to build is going to need some design.

---

<!-- .slide: class="center" -->
<!-- .slide: data-background="#661C0E" data-id="chapter-design" -->

### Chapter 1: Design.

# Stealing

Note: So let's jump into learning about design.

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="#661C0E" data-auto-animate data-id="chapter-design" -->

### Design

Main topics to learn:

1. Design Fundamentals <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
2. Typography <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
3. Layout <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
4. Colour Theory <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
5. Web Design <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
6. Creative Thinking <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
7. Motion Design <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
8. Prototyping <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
9. Testing <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
10. Information Architecture <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

Note: I'm not a designer, so I needed to learn the basics.

I started my quest by finding out all of the main topics.

Design Fundamentals: Heuristics of User Interface and Principles for Usable Design

Typography: Font pairing, sizing

Layout: Whitespace, composition, grid, scaling, rules (3rd, odds, golden rectangle?)

Colour Theory: Dark variants, pairing (I know there are tools, but I want to know the reasoning a little better)

Web Design: Why it's so different to print design

Creative Thinking: Stealing from other artists or techniques to get into the "creative" mindset

Motion Design: Subtle animations to draw attention

Prototyping: Wireframes to usable prototypes in black & white

Testing: Usability tests, A/B testing designs

Information Architecture: Site structure, user flow, user journey, content modelling, user guidance

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="#661C0E" data-auto-animate data-id="chapter-design" -->

### Design

I used a few tutorial websites such as: <!-- .element style="margin-top: 2em" -->

https://learnui.design <!-- .element style="color: #fff" -->

https://hackdesign.org <!-- .element style="color: #fff" -->

For creating and collaborating on the designs <!-- .element style="margin-top: 2em" -->

I decided I would use:

https://figma.com <!-- .element style="color: #fff" -->

Note: It does seem like a lot to learn to become a designer, right?

I only wanted to know the basics of each category, enough for me to understand some of the main concepts.

I felt motivated by the challenge to learn something new in a very short amount of time.

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="#661C0E" data-auto-animate data-id="chapter-design" -->

### Design

<img src="./assets/celebratedrupal8-desktop-orig.png" alt="CelebrateD8 Desktop Orig" class="move-up-down" style="object-fit: contain; float: left; max-height: 38em;">

Original desktop version of CelebrateDrupal8.com <!-- .element style="margin-left: 15em; margin-top: 1em; text-align: left;" -->

Note: I took a screenshot of the original CelebrateDrupal8 project which I planned to base my designs on.

I understood that good design is about stealing other designs that work well and I felt the Drupal community were familiar enough with the original design that I could reuse it.

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="#661C0E" data-auto-animate data-id="chapter-design" -->

### Design

<img src="./assets/celebratedrupal8-mobile-orig.png" alt="CelebrateD8 Mobile Orig" class="move-up-down" style="object-fit: contain; float: left; width: 8em;">

Original mobile version of CelebrateDrupal8.com <!-- .element style="margin-left: 10em; margin-top: 1em; text-align: left;" -->

Note: I also took the mobile version.

<!-- .slide: data-background="#661C0E" data-auto-animate data-id="chapter-design" -->

### Design

<img src="./assets/squint-desktop.png" alt="Squint Test" class="move-up-down" style="object-fit: contain; float: left; width: 16em;">

Squint test <!-- .element style="margin-left: 18em; margin-top: 1em; text-align: left;" -->

See what pops out <!-- .element class="fragment" style="margin-left: 18em; margin-top: 1em; text-align: left;" -->

Note: I performed a squint test on mobile and desktop, to see what popped out most from the old design.

This made me decide that I did not want to have a call to action button in the header as it distracts a bit too much on every single page.

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="#661C0E" data-auto-animate data-id="chapter-design" -->

### Design

<img src="./assets/celebratedrupal8-rough-blocks.png" alt="Rough blocks" class="move-up-down" style="object-fit: contain; float: left; width: 18em;">

Rough wireframe blocks <!-- .element style="margin-left: 19em; margin-top: 1em; text-align: left;" -->

Sample text length <!-- .element style="margin-left: 17em; margin-top: 1em; text-align: left;" -->

Help visualise if the blocks work well together with semi-realistic content <!-- .element class="fragment" style="margin-left: 17em; margin-top: 1em; text-align: left;" -->

Note: Add sample text to estimate the layout shifts.

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="#661C0E" data-auto-animate data-id="chapter-design" -->

### Design

<img src="./assets/celebratedrupal8-add-grid.png" alt="Align to grid" class="move-up-down" style="object-fit: contain; float: left; max-height: 44em;">

Align to grid <!-- .element style="margin-left: 16em; margin-top: 1em; text-align: left;" -->

Ensure clarity and flow <!-- .element class="fragment" style="margin-left: 16em; margin-top: 1em; text-align: left;" -->

Note: Align to grid to ensure clarity and flow.

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="#661C0E" data-auto-animate data-id="chapter-design" -->

### Design

<img src="./assets/celebratedrupal-add-colour.png" alt="Add colour" class="move-up-down" style="object-fit: contain; float: left; max-height: 58em;">

Add colour <!-- .element style="margin-left: 16em; margin-top: 1em; text-align: left;" -->

# 40 days until Drupal 9 is launched.

Note: Already 2 weeks had passed.

I learnt as much as I could in relation to design.

I had a repository created but it was very slim, so let's dive into.

<p style="font-weight: bold">How to build out a Drupal website before the official launch?</p>

Use the beta channel, or alpha if there is no beta available <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

<span style="margin-left: 2em">Started in late April 2020 with: Drupal 9.0.0-beta2</span> <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

Keep it up to date <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

Keep contrib modules to a minimum <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

Keep custom code to a minimum <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

Note: In order to build out a Drupal 9 project before the official release

I had to use the the beta channel with release: 9.0.0-beta2

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="#4C3D13" data-auto-animate data-id="chapter-development" -->

### Development

# Tech Stack Used

- TailwindCSS ( https://tailwindcss.com <!-- .element style="color: #fff" -->)
- Laravel Mix (opinionated Webpack builder)
- Drupal 9 ( <span style="color: #068de9">:-)</span> )
- SQLite for local development (Lando was also available)

Note: TailwindCSS made it really easy to theme the frontend in a very short amount of time.

Laravel Mix, I suppose I did not need this as it was overkill since I only use it to build out the TailwindCSS PostCSS setup.

Drupal 9 was very stable from beta2 onwards. I think I only had one issue pop up which resulted in me filing an issue to drupal.org.

I find developing natively with just PHP and a SQLite database is faster than booting up Docker. I generally only need to use it to export site-build changes to config via drush config export.

<!-- .slide: class="center" -->
<!-- .slide: data-background="#BFDBFE" data-id="chapter-begin" -->

### May 19th 2020

# 15 days until Drupal 9 is launched.

Note: Up to this point in time, I had worked a lot on site-building, some backend tweaking, sample content creation, and basic theming via Tailwind CSS.

I did everything openly and regularly posted my updates to Drupal Slack.

I did have some people show interest in helping out but they were busy with work and private things.

I was fine with that, at the end of the day we're all just volunteering our own time, and I highly value every second that anyone is able to give.

### Marketing

With under two weeks to Drupal 9 <!-- .element style="margin-top: 4em" -->

My original plan to launch the CelebrateDrupal.com website <span style="color: #fff600">1 week</span> in advance looked bleak.

I needed support. <!-- .element class="fragment" style="margin-top: 2em" -->

Note: With just under two weeks until Drupal 9 was due to be released.

I started to realise that my goal to release the website at least 1 week in advance was looking bleak.

I needed to reach out to the community for support.

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="#1C490D" data-auto-animate data-id="chapter-marketing" -->

### Marketing

I had a few people who were interested in helping. <!-- .element style="margin-top: 4em" -->

I setup an onboarding meeting for everyone.

I then created a 5-minute video showing the current state of the project.

Note: I setup an onboarding meeting and created a 5-minute video showing the currrent state of the project.

### Chapter 4: Content.

# Haircut

Note: Now that the website was looking good and the team were helping with marketing they needed some content to start to promote the website with.

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="#702459" data-auto-animate data-id="chapter-content" -->

### Content <!-- .element style="margin-bottom: 3em" -->

A good platform launch requires a good amount of content before the launch.

Therefore, to get the ball rolling,

I set out on a mission.

Note: In order to get the ball rolling, we needed the first video and the first photo.

So I set out on a mission to do just that.

---

And yes, upgrading to Drupal 9 is as easy as getting a haircut.

Note: Kristen Pol was sharing her excitement about her sons' drawings with us that we had to ensure we would use it for our first photo on the platform.

Kristen Pols' son did many other fantastic artwork for the Drupal community.

It definitely helped get people into the spirit.

# 6 days until Drupal 9 is launched.

# We went LIVE. <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

Note: With the pressure mounting, we had our MVP ready.

We needed to go-live before noon on the 28th May as the project would be featured in the WeeklyDrop newsletter.

I finalised the theming for the frontend and tested on a few different browsers with different view-ports (mobile, tablet, desktop).

We went live at 7am, 5 hours before the hard deadline.

It was a huge success, with over 84 submissions in the first day - still 6 days before Drupal 9 was due to be launched.

And what an achievement, something totally worth celebrating.

Let's fast forward a little in time.

### June 3rd 2020

# DrupalCon Global 2020.

Note: I had always envisaged the platform would be used for various events.

I had updated the default taxonomy term for all entity types to point to DrupalCon Global 2020.

This allowed me to easily group the content for a special DrupalCon photo.

<!-- .slide: data-background="#326A8D" data-auto-animate data-id="chapter-drupalconphoto" -->

### #DrupalConPhoto <!-- .element style="margin-bottom: 4em" -->

# Druplicon

Note: During the first remote conference, it became evident that we all missed being able to connect in-person with each other.

I wanted to give back to the community. To enhance the platform with it's own special DrupalCon photo.

I set out to design the Druplicon logo with CSS Grid values.

The final result is.
